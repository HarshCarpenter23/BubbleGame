# BubbleGame
HTML, CSS and Javascript used.
It is a simple web game to hit the number bubble which is asked in the Hit menu to increases your score.
I have used the concept of event bubbling in this web app.

Rules of the game:
1. You will get 60 seconds to score.
2. You should hit the number which will be displayed in the Hit box.
3. NO negative score or minus for wrong hit.
4. Final score will be displayed after the 60sec timer ends.
